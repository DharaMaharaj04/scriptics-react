                                <h1 className='reader-heading'>Protecting Your Manufacturing Floor: How Blackberry Cylance Defends Against Cybersecurity Threats without Disrupting Operations</h1>
                                <p className='reader-para'>Cybersecurity threats pose a significant risk to organizations of all sizes, and the stakes are especially high in operational technology (OT) environments like manufacturing floors. A cyber attack on a manufacturing floor can cause significant disruptions to production, leading to lost revenue, reputational damage, and even safety hazards. Traditional security measures can help protect against cyber threats, but they often require constant updates and maintenance, which can be disruptive to manufacturing floors and other OT environments. Additionally, many manufacturing floors don't have an internet connection, making it difficult to maintain traditional security measures.</p>
                                <p className='reader-para'>Blackberry Cylance provides a solution to these problems with its lightweight, self-defending security that doesn't require constant updates or an internet connection. This makes it an ideal solution for manufacturing floors and other OT environments that can't afford to be disrupted by security updates.</p>
                                <p className='reader-para'>Blackberry Cylance uses artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning algorithms to detect and prevent cyber threats in real-time. This approach is much more effective than traditional signature-based security solutions, which rely on known threat signatures to identify and block attacks. The problem with signature-based security is that it can only detect and block attacks that have already been seen before. Cybercriminals are constantly evolving their tactics, creating new and unknown threats that can easily bypass signature-based security solutions</p>
                                <p className='reader-para'>Blackberry Cylance's AI and machine learning algorithms are designed to identify patterns and anomalies in data, allowing it to detect potential threats even if they haven't been seen before. The solution is based on a mathematical model that uses machine learning to identify the characteristics of known malware and other threats. This model is then used to analyze and classify new data in real-time, allowing Blackberry Cylance to identify and block potential threats before they can cause any damage.</p>
                                <p className='reader-para'>Another key advantage of Blackberry Cylance is its ability to protect OT environments without requiring an internet connection. This is important for manufacturing floors and other OT environments that often operate in isolated networks. Blackberry Cylance's lightweight solution can be installed on-premises without requiring any connectivity to the cloud or other external services</p>
                                <p className='reader-para'>Blackberry Cylance also provides a range of features specifically designed for manufacturing floors and other OT environments. These include:
                                    <ul>
                                        <li>Whitelisting: Blackberry Cylance's application control feature uses a whitelist to control which applications can run on your systems. This prevents unauthorized applications from running and ensures that only approved software is used in your manufacturing processes.</li>
                                        <li>Device Control: Blackberry Cylance allows you to control which devices can be connected to your systems. This prevents unauthorized devices from accessing your systems and ensures that only authorized devices are used in your manufacturing processes.</li>
                                        <li>Runtime Protection: Blackberry Cylance continuously monitors your systems and processes to detect any anomalous behavior. This allows it to detect and prevent attacks that may occur during runtime.</li>
                                    </ul>
                                </p>
                                <p className='reader-para'>In addition to these features, Blackberry Cylance provides a range of management and reporting tools that allow you to monitor and manage your security environment. These tools include a centralized management console, reporting dashboards, and threat analysis reports.</p>
