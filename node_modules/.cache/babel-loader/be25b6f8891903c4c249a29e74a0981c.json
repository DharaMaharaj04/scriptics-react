<p>With an increase in hybrid working environments, enterprises today must constantly bolster organizational security to prevent data breaches. Demand for a clear view is also needed to prevent and protect from potential risks with the amount of data shared within an organization. Together, cyberthreats and endpoint chaos are putting organizations at risk while cutting into employee productivity and increasing IT costs. The BlackBerry® information protection solution CylanceAVERT™ has been designed to provide improved cyberthreat detection and remediation, all while offering end-to-end visibility to help manage all sensitive data no matter where it is stored or who has access to it. </p>\r\n                        <p>Traditionally, the main driver for adoption of DLP is to help meet regulatory compliance goals. Unfortunately, these solutions often become cost-prohibitive to maintain when extending to the more complex problem of IP protection from internal or external threats. This results in a significant number of DLP solutions being under-deployed or never deployed due to complexity and cost of ongoing management. </p>\r\n                        <p>CylanceAVERT is a cost-effective, cloud-native information protection solution that defends against external and insider threats through identification of your sensitive data-at-rest and detection of exfiltration of sensitive data to unauthorized locations, all while offering end-to-end visibility to help you manage all sensitive data no matter where it is stored and who has access to it. It enables organizations to safeguard their business’s sensitive data, which if accessed by unauthorized parties can lead to monetary and reputational damage. </p>\r\n                        <h3>CORE CAPABILITIES</h3>\r\n                        <h6>SINGLE PANE OF TRUTH</h6>\r\n                        <p>Pulls together a comprehensive picture of data at rest and data-in-motion, providing organizations with a clear understanding of where potential data leaks can arise, as well as how to prevent them from happening in the future.</p>\r\n                        <h6>FILE INVENTORY SERVICE</h6>\r\n                        <p>Crawls endpoints, identifies sensitive files as defined by policy, and stores a list of all sensitive files, allowing organizations to easily identify high-risk endpoints and users based on the amount and type of sensitive information.</p>\r\n                        <h6>SET POLICIES ON DATA EXFILTRATION EVENTS</h6>\r\n                        <p>Monitors email, web, and OS activities for sensitive data egress and identifies insiders sending sensitive data to unauthorized locations.</p>\r\n                        <h6>PRIVATE FILE EVIDENCE LOCKER</h6>\r\n                        <p>Collects company sensitive information but does not store data in the BlackBerry cloud.
